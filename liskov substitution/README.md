# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

- A subclass should be able to stand in for its superclass without causing errors. This means that subclasses should not override the behavior of the superclass in a way that changes the expected outcome.
