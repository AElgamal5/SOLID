# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes).

- Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

- This principle promotes the use of interfaces or abstract classes to decouple higher-level and lower-level components, making the system more flexible and easier to modify.
