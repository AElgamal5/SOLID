# Open closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- You should be able to add new functionality to existing code without altering its current behavior. This is often achieved through inheritance or interfaces, allowing new features to be added without modifying existing code.
